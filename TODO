TODO:
-

Might be useful:
- Change setup methods to setupclass methods in some tests in order 
  to make them faster
- Try mock objects (unittest.mock)

Things that have to be tested with the real pump:
- If a parameter number is specified but there is no parameter access, 
  will the parameter data be included in the return telegram?
- Is it OK to define an index when accessing an unindexed parameter?
- When is the "cannot change" error message used?
- What is the writability of parameters for which the manual doesn't specify 
  it?
- Does the pump return a parameter error if the parameter access code is 
  invalid?
- How does the pump behave when it is off? Is only the motor off? Does the 
  pump read/answer commands?
- Does the onoff command reset parameters?
- Real parameters have a default value of 0 and a minumum value of > 0. 
  How does this work?
- What happens if the frequency setpoint is set to an illegal value through 
  the setpoint command (without accessing parameters)?
- Should an invalid parameter index raise a parameter number error or 
  other error (currently VPump raises a parameter number error)?
