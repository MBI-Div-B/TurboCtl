TODO:
- ParameterException objects need a 'MEMBER' attribute, which links to the
  corresponding ParameterError member. (DONE, but needs docs and testing)
- Document the parameters.txt format better?
- Parameters should be an attribute and an optional initializer argument
  for TelegramBuilder and TelegramReader.
- Document individual enum members in codes.py?
- Pump errors could be tested by adding a raise_error method to virtualpump.
  E.g. vpump.raise_error(type='power_failure').
- Everything that can be private should probably be private.
- Sphinxify ui.table.
- Make sure the user understands that API.pump_on deosn't necassarily actually
  reflect the status of the pump. 

Might be useful:
- Change setup methods to setupclass methods in some tests in order 
  to make them faster
- Try mock objects (unittest.mock)

Things that have to be tested with the real pump:
- When are different status bits reported?
  What do the different control bits do?
- If a parameter number is specified but there is no parameter access, 
  will the parameter data be included in the return telegram?
- Is it OK to define an index when accessing an unindexed parameter?
- When is the "cannot change" error message used?
- What is the writability of parameters for which the manual doesn't specify 
  it?
- Does the pump return a parameter error if the parameter access code is 
  invalid?
- How does the pump behave when it is off? Is only the motor off? Does the 
  pump read/answer commands?
- Does the onoff command reset parameters?
- Real parameters have a default value of 0 and a minumum value of > 0. 
  How does this work?
- What happens if the frequency setpoint is set to an illegal value through 
  the setpoint command (without accessing parameters)?
- Should an invalid parameter index raise a parameter number error or 
  other error (currently VPump raises a parameter number error)?
- What is the hierarchy of parameter errors? If there are multiple things
  wrong with a telegram, which error is returned?
- Do volatile values disappear when the pump is turned off, or only when power is cut off.
- Does parameter 227 (warnings) work analogously compared to parameter 171 (error list).
- Can parameters be given a value of 0 even if their minimum value is reported as 1.401E-42?
