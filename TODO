TODO

Soon:
- Separate verbosity and error catching.
- Test the program with an actual pump
- Add instructions for installing and running the program
- Add automatic polling to the simple UI
- Document the shutdown feature of the pump
- Add instructions for using screen

Later:
- Fix the problem with less properly
- Add a warning about errors in the user manual
- Update test_ui
- Make sure all tests are ok and can be run automatically at once
- Investigate and fix the errors which are occasionally raised whenthe program
  is used. These are probably caused by receiving an invalid telegram.

Perhaps at some point:
- Improve the parser so that e.g. "list p [1, 2]" is valid syntax.
  The command parser could also be moved into a separate class, so that it
  could be tested more easily. Also, parser.py might be simplified by using
  the parsing modules in the standard library.
- Document the format in parameters.txt better? This might even be turned into
  e.g. a CSV file.
- Document individual enum members in codes.py.
- Rename WrongNumError to NumberError or something?
- Open the output of the help command with less?
- Add commands to set the setpoint (most important), save data, read errors
  etc.
- Move singledispatchmethod to datatypes.py.
- Run pylint/pycodestyle.
- The docstring of the read/write_parameter methods say
  "Raises ValueError if number or index have invalid values". Clarify this.
- Add a command to open the docs in a web browser.
- Merge the info and list commands into one with a boolean flag to use or not
  to use less.
- Add instructions for importing the API/control interface (and also add 
  those to the turboctl namespace)
- Make sure there are no TODO tags anywhere is the code.
- Fix the bug where closing TurboCtl in screen doesn't erase the UI text.
